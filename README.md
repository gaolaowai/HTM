# HTM
My own attempt to recreate some of the ideas/methods used by [Numenta](https://www.numenta.com/)'s NuPIC


Currently lacking the temporal-memory aspect, but does have basic encoder structure and spatial pooler.

Continuing WIP. Feel free to contribute.

Written for Python3. Uses numpy for matrix objects and operations.
